# Market Basket Analysis on Grocery Store

### Abstract:
This data science project focuses on the development of a comprehensive system for market basket analysis within the context of an online grocery store. Leveraging advanced association rule learning techniques, specifically the Apriori and FP-growth algorithms implemented with MLxtend, the project aims to uncover intricate patterns in customer purchasing behavior. The primary objective is to optimize the online shopping experience by providing personalized product recommendations, refining cross-selling strategies, and gaining valuable insights into customer preferences. The technology stack for deployment includes Django for the backend, PostgreSQL or MongoDB for the database, and a dynamic frontend using HTML, CSS, and JS, possibly incorporating React or Angular. Cloud services such as AWS, Heroku, or Azure will host the application, ensuring scalability and reliability. The project will utilize GitHub for version control and Notion for project management, fostering efficient collaboration. The anticipated outcomes include an innovative online grocery store empowered by data-driven decision-making, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction and business efficiency.
