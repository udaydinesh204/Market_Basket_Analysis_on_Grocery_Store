## Abstract

Market basket analysis is a critical tool in retail and e-commerce as it reveals patterns in customer behavior and purchasing trends. By examining transactional data, market basket analysis uncovers relationships between items commonly bought together, facilitating effective product recommendations, cross-selling strategies, and inventory management. Two widely used algorithms for association rule mining in this context are FP-Growth and Apriori. The FP-Growth algorithm employs a tree-based approach to efficiently generate frequent itemsets, minimizing computational complexity. In contrast, the Apriori algorithm, though conceptually straightforward, requires multiple passes through the data, potentially increasing computational overhead.

This research investigates the efficiency and performance of the Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms in market basket analysis using a UK-based online retail dataset sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. We compare the algorithms' results and assess their ability to generate association rules while evaluating their computational requirements. The findings provide insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach, offering guidance for choosing the appropriate algorithm for specific market basket analysis needs.
